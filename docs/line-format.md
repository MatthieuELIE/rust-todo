# Line format

```text
(A) 2026-09-01 Call the bank +finance @phone due:2026-09-15
x 2026-09-03 2026-09-01 Buy milk
```

A line is an optional `x` marker, an optional `(A)`–`(E)` priority, then dates:
the creation date on a pending task, the completion date followed by the creation date on a done one.
Everything after that is the description — `+project`, `@context` and `key:value` are kept verbatim.

`add` records the creation date, `do` records the completion date and drops the priority, as `todo.sh` does.
Anything the parser does not recognise stays in the description rather than being dropped.
